          People often marvel at a star programmer’s ability to pick up any
          language extremely fast. “This person must be gifted,” they’ll say.
          This person must be good at science and math. The truth is that
          becoming a master learner is a practice. The more you practice
          learning any skill, the more you will understand how to learn any
          programming language with the speed and agility of a star programmer.
          Each person is different. People think that there must be some
          shortest route to this learning problem. But the learning problem is
          tailored toward the type of thinker you are. Are you a bottom-up
          thinker, a top-down thinker, a visual learner, or an auditory learner?
          You are the architect who can design your learning solution. I am here
          to simply help you get there faster. Qualifications When I started
          programming 15+ years ago, I had to pick up four programming languages
          in six months for a project that was due at the end of the year. My
          career was riding on it. Before that year finished, I not only learned
          these four programming languages, but I also completed that project.
          When I started my career, I went on a graduate training program where
          for six weeks we had to pick up the entire undergraduate course work
          of various parts of finance: corporate finance, interest-rate
          products, equity products, etc. I barely passed that training program
          because up until that point, I had no prior finance education. But I
          passed the program. Am I gifted? No. Am I a master learner? No.
          Because I grew up in a household where I received no love unless I
          performed, the pressure enabled me to learn this one trick that I
          applied over and over again. The # 1 Trick in Learning I have found a
          trick that works for me through practice and pressure. I didn’t
          realize I found my trick until someone asked me one day, “Do you
          remember the books that you read from childhood?” I replied, “No, I
          don’t. But, I’ve internalized these books.” These were fiction books
          that this person was talking about. But I realized I’ve internalized
          the struggles from the characters and learned from the struggles of
          the characters. Even though I didn’t remember the details of the book,
          I didn’t have to go back to re-reading the book because I’ve
          internalized the most important parts of the book. How Do You Go About
          Internalizing the Most Important Concepts? If you study so-called
          gifted education, you will realize that gifted people are people who
          are more sensitive than the average person. The way they pick up
          knowledge fast is mainly due to their sensitivity. Because they are
          sensitive to anything presented, they can internalize the knowledge
          faster than anyone. All of us who are not gifted can pretend that we
          are gifted and implement a method to internalize concepts. This method
          will enable us to learn as a gifted person learns. We may take longer
          than the gifted person. But we will nevertheless get there faster than
          we did before. The method has to be tailored to the type of learner
          you are: visual learner, auditory learner, reading/writing learner, or
          kinesthetic learner. You can straddle a few different types and be in
          the middle of the quadrants. For instance, I am a visual learner who
          has learned to be a reading/writing learner at school. At work, due to
          my programming profession, I became a kinesthetic learner. By figuring
          out which type of learner you are, you can immerse yourself in the
          type of mediums that will enable you to learn the best. By immersing
          yourself in the medium, you will heighten your sensitivity to the
          subject. This way it is much easier to internalize the concepts.
